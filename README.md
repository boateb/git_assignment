a. What is an issue?
An issue is a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or any other type of work in a project on GitHub. Issues can be assigned to team members, labeled, and organized into projects.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a codebase in a Git repository. It allows developers to review, discuss, and suggest modifications before the changes are merged into the main branch.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Push your changes to a branch in your repository.
Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
Click the "New pull request" button.
Select the branch with your changes and compare it with the main branch.
Add a title and description, then click "Create pull request."

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions):
Go to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Settings" tab.
Select "Collaborators & Teams" from the sidebar.
Click "Add people," search for the collaboratorâ€™s GitHub username, and add them.
Set the permission level and click "Add."

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system used to track changes in code locally. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration, remote access, and sharing of code.

f. What does git diff do?
git diff shows the changes between commits, branches, or the working directory and the last commit, allowing you to see differences in the code.

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch, often named main or master, is the default branch in a Git repository where the source code considered to be stable is stored.

h. Should we directly push our changes into the main branch?
No, it's generally best practice to create a separate branch for changes, then open a pull request to merge them into the main branch. This allows for code review and testing.
